# Swift-iOS-Messaging-App
A messaging app written in Swift using firebase. This was really just a way to play with a range of static and dynamic UITableViews and UITableViewControllers with some custom cells.

## Features:
- Securely register and login with email & password using Firebase
- All data is securely stored in a Firestore.
- Create chats
- Add & remove users from chats
- All menus / data update in realtime so no delay between users.
- Change the bubble colour for each user and the colour for the chat.

## Things I've learnt during this project
- NoSQL Databases - how to structure and organise data.
- Firebase authentication.
- Firebase's NoSQL database Firestore.
- Creating and using custom cells within a table view.

## Packages used
- Firebase / Auth - for authentication
- Firebase / Firestore - for storage of the messages and the data
- IQKeyboardManager - to provide a easy way to have a better keyboard.
- ChameleonFramework - for pretty colours.
